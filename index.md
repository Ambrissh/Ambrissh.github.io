I am a second-year undergraduate student in the BS-MS program at IISER Berhampur, with a strong passion
for **quantum cryptography** and its real-world applications. My primary research interests lie in developing
software and services that integrate **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** and **Quantum Key Distribution
(QKD)** protocols to build secure communication systems.
In addition to my academic pursuits, I run a science communication platform and YouTube podcast series titled
**‘Metaverse Entangled’**, where I engage with graduate students and researchers from around the globe to
discuss their work and share insights from the frontiers of science. I also produce content aimed at making
complex scientific ideas more accessible to the general public.
I am highly motivated to deepen my expertise in quantum technologies and contribute meaningfully to the
advancement of quantum computing and cryptographic systems.
